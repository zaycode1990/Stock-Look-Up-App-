# Stock-Look-Up-App-




User Story:
This app allows me to see current price data on stocks based on he ticker symbol. I should be able to input a stock ticker symbol, with no caps lock or shift key hold down necessary.
When I hit submit I should get back the ticker symbol and the corresponding current price related data in tabular form. With each ticker symbol I submit, the table will dynamically grow 
allowing me to compare and contrast price data among the ticker symbols. There will be a delete button to delete the row of data that I do not need. There is a theme button that will,
initiate dark mode in case my eyes are tired. Also when I hover the mouse over the table data they will change colors so that if the table gets a bit long i now which column hold what
which specific data based on it's color. There is also a color blind mode in case I have any color-blindness I can still use the hover feature to discern data.
